# ðŸšŒ TransJakarta Corridor 2 â€“ Revenue & Operational Efficiency Analysis

##  Overview
This project analyzes **TransJakarta Corridor 2 (Pulogadungâ€“Harmoni)** to evaluate its **operational performance, revenue efficiency, and passenger distribution**.  
Despite being a major eastâ€“west corridor, it consistently reports **lower ridership** compared to high-demand routes like **Corridor 1 (Blok Mâ€“Kota)**.  
The analysis leverages **GPS, ridership, and financial data** to propose strategies for optimizing cost recovery, improving accessibility, and enhancing fare efficiency.

---

##  Objectives
1. **Identify factors** causing low ridership and revenue imbalance in Corridor 2.  
2. **Measure operational efficiency**, including bus headways, load factors, and idle time.  
3. **Develop data-driven recommendations** to increase passenger utilization and financial sustainability.

---

##  Methodology

### 1. Revenue & Cost Efficiency
- Compared **operational costs (fuel, labor, maintenance)** with **fare revenues** to estimate cost-recovery ratios.  
- Benchmarked Corridor 2 against Corridor 1 to identify **efficiency gaps**.

### 2. Passenger Flow & Fare Structure
- Analyzed **hourly and daily ridership** to detect peak and off-peak trends.  
- Assessed **load factor and fare collection** to determine utilization efficiency.

### 3. Geospatial & Accessibility Mapping
- Mapped **passenger density, stop proximity, and underserved areas** using GPS and ridership data.  
- Evaluated how distance from hubs affects ridership and accessibility.

##  Key Findings

| Aspect | Observation | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Passenger Concentration** | Highest ridership near **Harmoni** and **Senen** hubs | Centralized demand |
| **Low-Ridership Zones** | Stops east of Pulogadung < 10th percentile | Service underutilization |
| **Distance to Hubs** | Stops >4 km from hubs â†’ 25â€“40% fewer passengers | Accessibility gaps |
| **Scheduling Efficiency** | 10â€“15% potential gain from reallocating fleet by peak hours | Improved resource use |
| **Feeder Opportunity** | 5 potential feeder zones identified | Better last-mile connectivity |

---

##  Key Insights
- Corridor 2 **underperforms vs Corridor 1** due to **spatial and demand imbalance**.  
- **Feeder route expansion** could raise total ridership by **12â€“18%**.  
- **Dynamic scheduling** and **optimized headway intervals** could cut costs by **8â€“10%**.  
- **Fare integration** with **MRT/LRT** can improve revenue retention and network loyalty.

---

##  Recommendations

1. **Expand Feeder Network**
   - Target low-demand zones east of Pulogadung and South Jakarta.  
   - Use shuttle or microtransit routes to connect peripheral stops with hubs.

2. **Optimize Scheduling**
   - Reallocate buses from midday to peak hours (6â€“9 AM, 4â€“7 PM).  
   - Use real-time ridership data for **dynamic frequency adjustment**.

3. **Integrate Fare Systems**
   - Implement **MRT/LRT bundled tickets** to encourage multimodal travel.  
   - Offer **off-peak fare incentives** to balance demand.

4. **Improve Accessibility**
   - Enhance first- and last-mile connections (e.g., bike-sharing, walkways).  
   - Upgrade signage and passenger information systems.

5. **Data-Driven Decision Making**
   - Develop a **live dashboard** integrating GPS, ridership, and fare data.  
   - Apply **predictive analytics** for future demand and route optimization.

---

##  Expected Outcomes
- **+12â€“18% increase in ridership** through feeder integration.  
- **8â€“10% cost reduction** via smarter scheduling.  
- **Improved passenger experience** through better accessibility and real-time service adjustments.  
- **Sustainable revenue growth** through fare and non-fare diversification.

---

##  Tools & Techniques
- **Python (Pandas, Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis and visualization.  
- **Tableau Public** for interactive dashboards.  
- **Geospatial analysis** for identifying passenger clusters and accessibility gaps.
